analyzing citi bike data in New York city to uncover trends and visualize the data for non technical audiences

## Results
Because of my Tableau Public not allowing me to upload via the server, I found a way to export my findings to a Microsoft PowerPoint document, which is in this repository. I hope that is okay. 

The visualizations in this analysis will be crucial to both users of Citibikes, as well as those leading the business of Citibikes. As seen in the vizzes, these Citibikes are quite popular and Citi can analyze these vizzes by getting a better understanding of the demographic of their users, how long the bikes have been in use, and when they are due for maintenance. 

The checkout times by user and gender that most of the data are using Citibikes between 4-6am. Most riders during the weekday are using the citibikes on Thursdays between 5-6pm. Most of the subscribers are male that are using citibikes for their afterwork commute between 5-6pm.
